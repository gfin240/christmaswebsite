# Christmas Wish List Website
Welcome to the Christmas Wish List Website! 🎄

I created this platform using Flask and Python to streamline the process of sharing wishlists within my extended family during the festive season. The main goal is to offer an easy-to-use interface where family members can post their Christmas wishes. Here's how it works:

1. **Wishlist Sharing:**
Users can upload their wishlists, making it convenient for family members to view and select gifts.

2. **Anonymous Gift Removal:**
Family members who decide to fulfill a wish can anonymously remove the chosen item from the wishlist. This ensures a delightful surprise for the recipient on Christmas day.

3. **Secrecy Maintained:**
To maintain an element of surprise, users won't be able to see what gifts have been removed from their wishlists. The excitement builds up until the actual gift exchange!

This project was my first foray into website development, providing valuable experience in setting up a database to record wishlist entries and manage the removal of purchased gifts. I hope this platform adds an extra layer of joy and excitement to your family's Christmas celebrations!

Feel free to explore the code and contribute your ideas to make this Christmas Wish List Website even more festive! 🎁🎅
